<p>
Cultivation of cultivated grapes (viticulture) began about 6000-8000 years ago in the Neolithic in the Middle East.


The earliest archaeological evidence of a developed wine-making culture dating back to the 6th millennium BC was found on the territory of Georgia, 
including a ceramic vessel 8000 years old with traces of wine.
The oldest found winery dates back to the turn of the 5th-4th millennium BC and is located in Armenia (Areni cave).

<p>
In the course of deciphering the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, it was possible to read the records concerning the technology of cultivating dark grapes. 
A great contribution to the development of viticulture was made by the Phoenicians, from whom the Carthaginians learned to cultivate grapes, and the ancient Greeks. 
Thucydides believed that the inhabitants of the Mediterranean said goodbye to barbarism when they began to cultivate grapes and olive. 
Even before our era, Mago and Cato the Elder gave instructions on how to care for the vine. 
</p>

<p>
The culmination of ancient Roman viticulture was the work of Columella, in which he advised instead of trees to use special trellises to support long vines.


The culture of growing grapes later spread to the more northern regions of Europe, and also spread to all continents, with the exception of Antarctica. 
In North America, you can find wild-growing endemic grapes that were part of the diet of the Indians. 
Since these species were deemed unfit for winemaking by European colonists, European grape varieties were introduced to America.

<p>In the old days in Central Asia, local residents sealed bunches of grapes in clay cones, which made it possible to preserve the freshness of the berries for a long time.</p>

The fruits of grapes, as well as the products of its processing, have valuable nutritional qualities.


There are many varieties and hybrids of grapes. 
It is believed that the most widely distributed variety is white Kishmish, also known as Thompson sidlis - a dessert grape variety with very small, 
almost imperceptible seeds. 
The second place among the most common grape varieties is occupied by Ayren. 
Other popular varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Grenache, Tempranillo, Riesling and Chardonnay.

<p>
Sugar in grape berries is contained mainly in the form of glucose. 
One kilogram of grape berries, depending on the variety, the degree of ripening of the crop and the conditions of its cultivation, 
contains up to 300 or more grams of sugar. 
In addition, grape berries also contain from 0.5 to 1.4% of tartaric, malic and other organic acids, 0.3-0.5% of minerals, 
in particular phosphorus, iron, calcium, etc., 0.15-0.9% of protein substances, 0.3-1% of pectins, as well as vitamins A (carotene), 
B1 (thiamine, aneurine), B2 (riboflavin), C (ascorbic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), PP (niacin) and vitamin P.

</p>

<p>

The grapes are eaten fresh or dried, turning them into raisins (dried seedless grapes) or into kishmish and coriander (dried seedless grapes). 
Grapes are used in the production of wine. Compotes, juices, marinades and so on are also prepared from grapes. 
They are used for decorative purposes.


Grape juice contains a large amount of glucose, fructose, which are easily absorbed by the body, potassium cations, organic acids, trace elements. 
The product is quite high in calories (70-150 kcal / 100 g).


White, pink and red wines, brandy, as well as cognac alcohol are obtained from grape juice by alcoholic fermentation.

<h4>Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs</h4>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The consumption of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. 
Their toxicity to dogs can cause the animal to develop acute kidney failure 
(the sudden development of kidney failure) with anuria (a lack of urine production) and may be fatal.

<p>
Before you start growing grapes, you need to choose the variety that you need. 
There are table grape varieties for direct consumption or processing into juice or raisins, as well as wine grapes that are more suitable for winemaking. 
Perhaps you prefer grapes that produce fruits of a specific color, the so-called "white" or "red" grapes, or it will be important for you that the fruits are seedless. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, there are decorative grape varieties that require minimal maintenance, but also do not yield such a yield of delicious berries. 
You can find out about all this, as well as about which grape varieties are suitable for your climate, at your nearest grape nursery.

</p>
<p>
After you have chosen the grape variety you need, you need to choose a place for planting for the seedling.

The vineyard should be sunny and sheltered from the wind, for example by the southern wall of a house, a barn or a south-facing fence with well-drained soil. 
The general rules for planting fruit plants also apply to planting vines.

</p>
<p>
Vine care consists in timely watering, pruning and shaping of the vine. 
The winegrowing community has accumulated a wealth of knowledge about grape care, which you can learn about from specialized literature or on the Internet forums.
